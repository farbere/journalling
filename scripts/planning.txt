Each day the user can journal about any of a collection of topics.

Each topic should have metadata, determining how the user interacts with it.

Examples (for brainstorming):
1) Developing hobby
2) Exercise
3) Once a week
4) Miscellaneous life crap

There should be a script to run for creating new topics,
and for logging a day's activities for a given topic.

There should be a script for returning all logged activities
for a given topic, in a given timeframe.

Each topic (e.g. a hobby or regular event)
is a collection of activities (instances of that hobby/event),
along with metadata describing the topic.

I want to be able to run a script that can tell, 
by the time at which it is run, which topics should
be updated with new activities.

For example, my running topic should be updated every day
except Saturday. My rent payment topic should be updated
every 1st of the month. My Apocalypse World topic should be
updated every Thursday.

Thus, each topic needs an attribute describing when it
should be updated.

I can also use this to get "points" or "consistency":
if I do upload a new activity at the expected intervals
(assuming the topic is regular) then I get points.

Of course, there should also be the option of irregular topics.
