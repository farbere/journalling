Each day the user can journal about any of a collection of topics.

Each topic should have metadata, determining how the user interacts with it.

Examples (for brainstorming):
1) Developing hobby
2) Exercise
3) Once a week
4) Miscellaneous life crap

There should be a script to run for creating new topics,
and for logging a day's activities for a given topic.

There should be a script for returning all logged activities
for a given topic, in a given timeframe.
